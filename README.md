## Features

- Automate sending of WhatsApp messages using Generative AI  
- Intelligent, context-aware responses powered by GenAI  
- Useful for reminders, notifications, and smart auto-replies  
- Modular and easy to extend for custom workflows  

---

## How It Works

1. Capture or prepare outbound message content  
2. Send message input to a Generative AI model (like OpenAI) to generate thoughtful, context-aware text  
3. Use a WhatsApp integration (via web automation, API, or gateway) to send the AI message to a recipient  
4. Optionally log sent messages or responses for review and auditing  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python — main programming language  
- Generative AI (e.g., OpenAI GPT) — for generating message content  
- WhatsApp integration (e.g., WhatsApp Web automation or Business API gateways)  
- Supporting libraries — such as HTTP clients, Selenium, or others as needed  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed  
- Access to a Generative AI service (e.g. OpenAI API key)  
- WhatsApp access via supported automation method (e.g., API, web automation)  

### Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanchauhan786/whatsappauto.git
cd whatsappauto
````

Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (adjust based on your actual requirements):

```bash
pip install openai requests selenium
```

---

## How to Use

1. Configure your API keys (e.g., OPENAI\_API\_KEY) and WhatsApp connection method
2. Prepare a message prompt or intent for the AI to generate the message content
3. Run the main script to generate the message and automate sending via WhatsApp
4. Monitor logs or console output for delivery confirmation

## Future Improvements

* Add support for incoming message handling and auto-replies
* Support richer media (images, voice notes) via WhatsApp
* Implement scheduling or triggered workflows for periodic messages
* GUI or CLI interface for easier setup and management
* Integrate with databases or logs for message history and analytics
